# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game developed using Python's `tkinter` library. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

## Features

- **Two-player game:** Play as either "X" or "O" with a friend.
- **Simple and intuitive UI:** Built using the `tkinter` library for a clean and straightforward graphical interface.
- **Game status updates:** The game indicates whose turn it is, and announces the winner or a tie.
- **Restart functionality:** Easily restart the game without closing the application.

## How to Run the Game

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Running the Game

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YUVARAJMORLA/tictactoe_python.git
   cd tic-tac-toe
   
### Run the Python Script:
```
python tic_tac_toe.py
```
This will launch the Tic Tac Toe game window.

### Building an Executable (Optional)
If you'd like to distribute the game as a standalone executable, you can use PyInstaller. This allows others to play the game without needing to install Python works on PC/Desktop.
```
pip install pyinstaller
```

### Create the Executable: Run the following command to generate an executable from your Python script:

```
pyinstaller --onefile tic_tac_toe.py
